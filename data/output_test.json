If we're gonna downplay #HouseOfGucci's box-office performance because it cost 75 million to make, let's be fair and mention that Oscar hopeful flop 'King Richard' had a 50 million budget. Ah, but the latter has been seen by 68 trillion people on VOD so it's all fine, amirite? https://t.co/fJSuXhi3BL	https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1467637815940988931	0.5713
